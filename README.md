This is a project I created for my Phase-2  of Flatiron School. My goals were to use what I learned from React App development to create my own single page application. I used programmatic Navigation to create a easy and functional navigation bar that includes three routes (/home, /catmemes, /createcatmeme). Learning the importance of a controlled form, I have one featured in my app where you can make a post request and it will add two captions and an image to the db.JSON file. I am also using state to keep my memes updated when I make specific fetch requests.

To avoid potential erors, I used the create-react-app command to set up a foundation to easily work with.

My app is made up of JSX, Vanilla JS, CSS, and React Router.
